            We have a unique naming in the web technologies. I learned iOS as

            are using only tools provided by operating system vendors such as
            Apple and Google in this case. What cross-platform applications aims
            is to have a one code base to rule them all. It is economically and
            technically ambitions goal and you have to do some trade-offs. Most
            of the cross-platform applications are not solid due to the need of
            refinements.

          Hermes project, we have realized that we could do better with the
          engineering resources we have. At that time, EMR had 3 UI engineers
          and 1 iOS engineer. So each feature was repeated in the mobile and the
          web. Mobile was also iOS only. It wasn't the ideal way to spend energy
          so I started to think about a solution

          EMR is a CRUD application at the core. We added video chat on top of
          CRUD application. Most of the we read and display data on the
          frontend. If user does any add or update to the database we also
          render it on the UI. It doesn't matter it is an Apple Watch app,
          Oculus VR App, or Apple Glass app(Coming soon). What it means is if we
          could cross-platform data layer, we would be able to save enourmous
          eng time. And eng time means efficiency and we could spend remaining
          time to improve UX and do fancy/fun things

          Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native
          binaries, which can run without a virtual machine. It is an LLVM based
          backend for the Kotlin compiler and native implementation of the
          Kotlin standard library. Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow
          compilation for platforms where virtual machines are not desirable or
          possible, for example, embedded devices or iOS. It solves the
          situations when a developer needs to produce a self-contained program
          that does not require an additional runtime or virtual machine.

            I heard first about React Native Web with this blog post. I was
            doing some research on my own after working consumer app. I was like
            oh boy this is so cool to work on mobile apps. Is there any way to
            combine components across the board. React's motto is learn once
            apply every where and Java's motto is `write once and run anywhere`.
            How about altering React motto to match with Java's claim? It seemed
            like it is possible thanks to some difficult metro/webpack bundler.
            This post explains how you could accomplish it.

          Pretty cool technology. Developed at Facebook for their most
          downloaded iOS app in the universe. Their main goal was to increase
          developer productivity. They first announced it for iOS. and build
          Android later. Historically, iOS first so they have solid iOS support.
          Most of the industry needs CRUD applications if they are not game or
          XR(x reality, AR, VR, MX(mixed reality) or everything in between).
          Airbnb was the first adapter of React and they proved that React has
          capacity to be used in big projects. They adopted react native as
          well. Then removed it because it wasn't good for their use case. We
          don't know for sure but Facebook Marketplace is purely written in
          React Native. Since React Native is using declarative syntax of React
          it has smooth onboarding for people coming from web development ---
          React Native provides you the code reuse service for deployment of
          code on two different platforms such as iOS & Android. Because of code
          reuse service react-native saves up to 40% of the total development
          cost.

          -- Live reload provides you the service of reading & compiling a file
          that can be modified by developers for presenting in front of a
          simulator. It can also reload the app on its own from the initial
          stage. Live reload can enable you to see the result of any recent
          changing to the programming. Live reload will provide you with a
          two-screen service so that on one you can modify the code and see the
          result on the other screen. --- Since we are pretty much React shop,
          it is pretty big selling point in our organization

          After creating the project, I was able to render cross platform login
          page which was really cool for me but it wasn't enough. I wanted to
          have proof of concept and that's why I want something quick. I went to
          EMR UI app, copied all data layer and added it to my POC project. It
          didn't work for sure. EMR UI was using ES5 style imports and export
          which you can't use with Metro bundler. So I was like a mac who runs
          90% of memory and CPU for 3 hours. It took me literally 3 hours 11
          minutes to get it working once it is working I knew that we're into
          something big. This was big since we were able to accomplish the first
          and foremost goal instantaniously. We have data layer which includes
          network calls, their side effects, sagas, and redux store inherited
          from legacy EMR. BOOM BOOM BOOM

            Routing was a hard topic. Once you have react and react native, they
            converge pretty much everything other than routing. We don't have
            browser routing on mobile applications. No query params, no history,
            no nothing. React Navigation has beta web support but wasn't
            production ready. In order to have the best of both worlds, I
            implemented two routers. React Router Dom is inherited from EMR-UI
            project. I was pretty much familiar with React Navigation which is
            basically React Native navigation but that name was taken already.
            After implementing login flow things were ok.

            as isomorphic packages. Not all the packages have this spec so we
            should do due diligence when we want to introduce a package.
            packages/web/config-overrides.js has many examples on how you can
            introduce metro based packages to webpack based configurations

            Babel is a transpiler. What?!? Well a transpiler is a tool that
            reads source code written in one programming language, and produces
            the equivalent code in another language. React Native uses Babel to
            convert React syntax and the newer ES5+ syntax into code that can be
            run in a JavaScript environment that doesn’t support those features.
            Out of the box Babel doesn’t do anything. It basically parses the
            code and then generates the same code back out again. In order to
            introduce some magic you need to integrate plugins (or presets, a
            set of plugins) for Babel to do anything. Plugins and presets can be
            installed as packages using yarn (or npm) — a package manager for
            JavaScript — declaring them in a file called package.json. Packages
            are available as dependencies or devDependencies. The difference
            relies on their usage. In fact, while the former are required at
            runtime, the latter are required during development.
